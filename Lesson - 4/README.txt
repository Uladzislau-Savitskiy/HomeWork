Important note: There is a riddle as they say "from Steve Jobs". There are two buckets, one 3 liters and the other 5 liters and an unlimited amount of water. The user can

    Pour water into any bucket.
    Pour water from any bucket.
    Pour water from one bucket to another.
User wins if he managed to get exactly 4 liters.

Acceptance criteria:

    1 The user enters one of seven commands:
        fill_5l
        fill_3l
        pour_5l
        pour_5l
        pour_from_5_to_3
        pour_from_3_to_5
        exit
    2 The program runs until the user gets 4 liters or out.
    3 There can't be a negative amount of water in the buckets.
    4 There cannot be more liters in the pails than the pail is designed to hold (3L and 5L).
    5 The program should have a move counter and return to the user the number of moves for which he solved the given task.
    6 Below is an incomplete prototype code, finalize it.
